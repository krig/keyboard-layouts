# Miscreant

An alternative keyboard layout.

This is the keyboard layout that I am currently using.
I created this repo ao I have access to the layout
files on other computers.

## Recommendation

Do I recommend that anyone else uses this layout? No.
For anyone starting from QWERTY today, I would
recommend the [Gallium](https://github.com/GalileoBlues/Gallium) layout.

It is probably a better choice for most people.
The biggest problem with Gallium for me is B on
upper left pinky, which is not great for Swedish
where -BB- is fairly common as in SNABB, the swedish
word meaning FAST.

## Layout

Regular/ortholinear version:

```
q w h f k j p o u /
r s n t m y c a e i
x b l d v z g . ' ,
```

[Angle Mod](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html) version:

```
q w h f k j p o u /
 r s n t m y c a e i
  b l d v x z g . ' ,
```

The repository includes downloadable layout files for Mac OS. Install them into `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.

## Background

I have written a short essay about the layout [here](https://write.as/oferlund/designing-a-keyboard-layout-part-3).

## Variant

This variation has better roll stats, but I haven't
bothered switching to it.

Another possible mod would be to swap M and B.

```
q f h p k j w o u /
r s n t m y c a e i
x b l d v z g . ' ,
```
